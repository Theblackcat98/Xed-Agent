# AI Plugin Integration for Xed Editor

## 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1.1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating an AI-powered plugin into the Xed text editor. The goal is to enhance the user's coding experience by providing intelligent features and assistance directly within the editor.

### 1.2. Vision

To create a seamless and intuitive AI-assisted coding experience within the Xed editor, empowering developers to write better code faster.

### 1.3. Target Audience

The primary target audience is software developers who use the Xed editor for their daily coding tasks. This includes developers of all experience levels, from beginners to experts.

### 1.4. Key Features

The AI plugin will offer the following core features:

*   **Intelligent Code Completion:** Provide context-aware code completions that go beyond simple token matching. The AI should suggest entire lines or blocks of code based on the current context.
*   **Code Generation:** Allow users to generate code from natural language descriptions. For example, a user could type a comment like `// function to download a file from a URL` and the AI would generate the corresponding function.
*   **Code Refactoring:** Offer intelligent refactoring suggestions, such as simplifying complex code, improving readability, and fixing potential bugs.
*   **Inline Chat and Q&A:** Provide a chat interface where users can ask coding-related questions and get answers from the AI, all without leaving the editor.

### 1.5. Success Criteria

The success of the AI plugin will be measured by the following criteria:

*   **Adoption Rate:** The number of Xed users who install and actively use the plugin.
*   **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from users, measured through surveys and reviews.
*   **Performance:** The plugin should be responsive and not introduce any noticeable lag or performance degradation to the editor.
*   **Accuracy and Relevance:** The AI-powered suggestions and answers should be accurate, relevant, and genuinely helpful to the user.

## 2. Task List

The following is a high-level task list for the implementation of the AI plugin:

1.  **Set up the Development Environment:**
    *   Install necessary dependencies for plugin development.
    *   Create a new repository or a new branch in the existing Xed repository for the plugin.

2.  **Develop the Core Plugin Infrastructure:**
    *   Create the basic plugin structure that integrates with the Xed editor.
    *   Implement a communication channel between the plugin and a backend AI service.

3.  **Implement Intelligent Code Completion:**
    *   Integrate with a code completion AI model.
    *   Develop the UI for displaying code completion suggestions.
    *   Ensure the suggestions are context-aware and relevant.

4.  **Implement Code Generation:**
    *   Integrate with a code generation AI model.
    *   Design a user-friendly way for users to trigger code generation from natural language.

5.  **Implement Code Refactoring:**
    *   Integrate with a code refactoring AI model.
    *   Develop a mechanism for suggesting and applying refactorings.

6.  **Implement Inline Chat and Q&A:**
    *   Create a chat interface within the Xed editor.
    *   Integrate with a conversational AI model to answer coding questions.

7.  **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    *   Write unit tests and integration tests for all features.
    *   Conduct thorough manual testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
    *   Test for performance and responsiveness.

8.  **Documentation and Release:**
    *   Write clear and concise documentation for users and developers.
    *   Package the plugin for distribution.
    *   Announce the release and gather user feedback.

This PRD and task list will serve as a guide for the development of the AI plugin for the Xed editor. The plan will be iterated upon as the project progresses and we gather more feedback.
